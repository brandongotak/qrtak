## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. **DO** report via one of these methods:

- **Private disclosure**: Contact the maintainers directly

### 3. **Include the following information**:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 4. **Response timeline**:
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

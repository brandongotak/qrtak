# Product Requirements Document: TAK Onboarding Platform

* **Document Version:** 0.2
* **Date:** July 10, 2025
* **Author/Owner:** Product Management
* **Status:** Proposed

### 1. Executive Summary

The Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) ecosystem is a powerful tool for situational awareness, but its effectiveness is often hampered by a slow, error-prone, and manually intensive client configuration process. The **TAK Onboarding Platform** will be an offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to eliminate this friction entirely. By providing a simple, intuitive interface for generating configuration QR codes and comprehensive preference management, the platform will enable rapid, reliable, and consistent deployment of TAK clients at any scaleâ€”from a single user to a multi-agency mass incident.

The platform will support the full spectrum of ATAK configuration capabilities, including:
- **Basic Enrollment**: Server connection setup via QR codes
- **Advanced Preferences**: Complete access to 711+ ATAK preference keys across 9 categories
- **Data Package Generation**: Create comprehensive deployment packages
- **Template Management**: Pre-built and custom configuration templates
- **Mass Deployment**: Bulk generation for large-scale operations

This document outlines the vision, features, and phased rollout plan, starting with a core utility MVP and evolving into a comprehensive suite of tools for complete TAK client management.

### 2. The Problem

Onboarding users to a TAK server is a critical point of failure, especially in high-stress environments. The problems manifest at three levels:

* **The Individual User:**
    * **Typo Terror:** Manual entry of long, complex server hostnames, ports, and passwords on mobile devices is a primary source of connection failures.
    * **Cognitive Overload:** Users must remember multi-step processes for importing server profiles, data packages, and setting preferences, often leading to missed steps.
    * **Preference Complexity:** ATAK offers 711+ configurable preferences across 9 categories, but users lack tools to easily discover, configure, and deploy these settings.

* **The Team Lead / Administrator:**
    * **Onboarding Bottleneck:** Admins waste significant time verbally walking each user through the same setup process, a method that is inefficient and does not scale.
    * **Configuration Drift:** Ensuring every user has the identical, agency-approved configuration (SOPs) is nearly impossible, leading to operational inconsistencies.
    * **Limited Configuration Control:** Admins struggle to enforce standardized preferences across teams, leading to inconsistent user experiences and operational inefficiencies.

* **The Mass Incident (Scale):**
    * **Logistical Chaos:** During a mass emergency, attempting to configure hundreds of mutual-aid responders with different configurations (Police, Fire, EMS) creates an unmanageable bottleneck at check-in points.
    * **Preference Management:** Deploying role-specific configurations with appropriate preferences becomes impossible without proper tools.

### 3. The Solution & Vision

The TAK Onboarding Platform will be a browser-based, serverless PWA that acts as the single source of truth for complete client configuration, from basic enrollment to advanced preference management.

Our vision is to create a comprehensive tool where an administrator can, in a calm environment, pre-define complete configuration **Profiles** for different teams, including:
- Basic server enrollment settings
- Advanced ATAK preferences (identity, display, network, GPS, communication, tools, navigation, notifications, system)
- Data package configurations
- Role-specific templates

In the field, these profiles can be deployed instantly and in parallel via QR codes displayed on a screen or, more effectively, printed on physical handouts. The end-user experience will be reduced to simply pointing their device's camera at a piece of paper. This transforms the onboarding process from a high-friction, serial task into a frictionless, parallel one, ensuring every responder gets online quickly and with the correct configuration.

### 4. Goals & Objectives

| Goal | Objective | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Increase Speed** | Drastically reduce the time required to configure a TAK client. | Reduce average client configuration time from >5 minutes to <30 seconds. |

### 6.1 QR Code Format Compliance

All QR codes generated by the TAK Onboarding Platform must strictly adhere to the official TAK client formats for interoperability and reliability. For the full technical specification, field definitions, and up-to-date examples, see [docs/qr-formats.md](qr-formats.md).

### 6.2 Data Package Integration

The platform will support linking to TAK data packages for comprehensive client configuration. Data packages provide pre-configured settings, certificates, plugins, and map sources. For complete technical specifications on creating and deploying data packages, see [docs/data-packages.md](data-packages.md).

### 6.3 Preference Key Compliance

The platform will support all documented ATAK preference keys as specified in the [ATAK Preference Keys Technical Specification](ATAK-Preference-Keys-Technical-Specification.md). This includes:
- 711+ preference keys across 9 categories
- Full data type support (string, boolean, integer, long)
- Validation patterns and value constraints
- Real-time validation and error checking
- Compatibility checking for different ATAK versions

### 7. User Flow Scenario: Mass Incident Onboarding

1.  **Preparation (Day Before):** Chris, the EOC Comms Tech, opens the TAK Onboarding Platform on his laptop. He creates three profiles: "Police," "Fire," and "EMS." For each, he inputs the correct server data and links to the relevant data packages (containing certificates, plugins, and map sources). Using the preference editor, he configures role-specific settings:
    - **Fire Profile**: Team color set to 'Red', role set to 'Team Lead', coordinate display set to 'UTM', large text mode enabled for field visibility
    - **Police Profile**: Team color set to 'Blue', role set to 'Team Member', GPS set to 'WRGPS' for external GPS support, location reporting set to 'Dynamic'
    - **EMS Profile**: Team color set to 'Green', role set to 'Medic', communication preferences configured for emergency response, notification settings optimized for medical operations

2.  **Deployment (Day Of):** At the staging area, Chris selects all three profiles and clicks "Generate Handouts." He prints 100 copies of the resulting 3-page document, each containing role-specific QR codes with comprehensive preference configurations.

3.  **Check-in:** He sets up three check-in tables, each with the corresponding stack of handouts.

4.  **Onboarding:** Maria, the paramedic, arrives. She is directed to the "EMS" table, where she picks up a handout. She opens her ATAK client, scans the QR codes on the sheet, and in under a minute is connected to the EMS server with the correct maps loaded and all preferences optimized for medical response operations. She never had to speak to Chris or type anything.

### 8. Release Plan & Roadmap

### 9. Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

* This platform will **not** have a server-side backend or require user accounts. All user-generated data (Profiles) is stored locally in the browser.
* This platform will **not** host any files (e.g., data packages). It only links to them or generates them locally.
* This platform will **not** be a native application distributed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
* This platform will **not** directly connect to or manage TAK servers. It only generates configuration data.
* This platform will **not** include real-time collaboration features. All configuration is done locally.

### 10. Assumptions & Dependencies

* **Assumption:** End-users have a functional version of ATAK or iTAK capable of scanning QR codes.
* **Dependency:** The platform's functionality is dependent on the `tak://` URL schema defined by the TAK Product Center. Any changes to this schema may require an update to the tool.
* **Dependency:** The platform relies on the ATAK Preference Keys Technical Specification for preference definitions and validation rules.
* **Assumption:** Users have basic familiarity with ATAK concepts and terminology.

### 11. Open Questions

* What are the top 10 most critical/common preferences that should be highlighted in the preference editor interface?
* Should a "dark mode" theme be prioritized for low-light/field environments?
* What level of preference validation should be performed client-side vs. relying on ATAK's built-in validation?
* How should the platform handle deprecated or version-specific preference keys?
* What security considerations should be addressed for preference configurations that might contain sensitive information?

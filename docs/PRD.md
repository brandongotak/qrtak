# Product Requirements Document: TAK Onboarding Platform

* **Document Version:** 1.0
* **Date:** July 18, 2025
* **Author/Owner:** Product Management
* **Status:** Proposed

### 1. Executive Summary

The Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) ecosystem is a powerful tool for situational awareness, but its effectiveness is often hampered by a slow, error-prone, and manually intensive client configuration process. The **TAK Onboarding Platform** is an offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to eliminate this friction entirely. By providing a simple, intuitive interface for generating configuration QR codes, the platform enables rapid, reliable, and consistent deployment of TAK clients at any scaleâ€”from a single user to a multi-agency mass incident.

The platform currently supports:
- **ATAK Enrollment**: Server connection setup via QR codes for Android devices
- **iTAK Configuration**: Server connection setup via QR codes for iOS devices
- **URL Import**: Data package deployment via QR codes
- **Profile Management**: Save and load configuration sets for quick deployment
- **PWA Support**: Offline-first functionality for field operations

This document outlines the current implementation and future roadmap for evolving into a comprehensive suite of tools for TAK client management.

### 2. The Problem

Onboarding users to a TAK server is a critical point of failure, especially in high-stress environments. The problems manifest at three levels:

* **The Individual User:**
    * **Typo Terror:** Manual entry of long, complex server hostnames, ports, and passwords on mobile devices is a primary source of connection failures.
    * **Cognitive Overload:** Users must remember multi-step processes for importing server profiles and data packages, often leading to missed steps.
    * **Configuration Complexity:** Getting the correct server connection details into the device requires careful typing and verification.

* **The Team Lead / Administrator:**
    * **Onboarding Bottleneck:** Admins waste significant time verbally walking each user through the same setup process, a method that is inefficient and does not scale.
    * **Configuration Drift:** Ensuring every user has the identical, agency-approved configuration (SOPs) is nearly impossible, leading to operational inconsistencies.
    * **Limited Deployment Tools:** Admins lack efficient methods to deploy configurations to multiple users simultaneously.

* **The Mass Incident (Scale):**
    * **Logistical Chaos:** During a mass emergency, attempting to configure hundreds of mutual-aid responders with different configurations (Police, Fire, EMS) creates an unmanageable bottleneck at check-in points.
    * **Role-Based Deployment:** Deploying role-specific configurations (Police, Fire, EMS) requires separate setup processes.

### 3. The Solution & Vision

The TAK Onboarding Platform is a browser-based, serverless PWA that serves as the primary tool for TAK client configuration through QR code generation.

The current implementation allows administrators to:
- Pre-define server connection **Profiles** for different teams
- Generate QR codes for ATAK enrollment (Android)
- Generate QR codes for iTAK configuration (iOS)
- Generate QR codes for data package imports
- Save and manage configuration profiles for quick reuse

In the field, these configurations can be deployed instantly via QR codes displayed on a screen or printed on physical handouts. The end-user experience is reduced to simply pointing their device's camera at a QR code. This transforms the onboarding process from a high-friction, serial task into a frictionless, parallel one.

### 4. Goals & Objectives

| Goal | Objective | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Increase Speed** | Drastically reduce the time required to configure a TAK client. | Reduce average client configuration time from >5 minutes to <30 seconds. |
| **Improve Reliability** | Eliminate configuration errors caused by manual data entry. | Achieve a >99% success rate for first-time connections using generated QR codes. |
| **Ensure Consistency** | Enable administrators to enforce standard configurations (SOPs) across all users. | 100% of configurations deployed via a Profile will be identical. |
| **Enable Scalability**| Solve the mass onboarding bottleneck at large-scale events. | Enable a single administrator to prepare and deploy configurations for >100 users per hour. |
| **Offline Capability** | Ensure the tool works in austere field environments. | 100% functionality available offline after initial load. |
| **Cross-Platform Support** | Support both ATAK (Android) and iTAK (iOS) clients. | Generate valid QR codes for both platforms. |

### 7. User Flow Scenario: Mass Incident Onboarding

1. **Preparation (Day Before):** Chris, the EOC Comms Tech, opens the TAK Onboarding Platform on his laptop. He creates three profiles: "Police," "Fire," and "EMS." For each, he inputs the correct server data and links to the relevant data packages (containing certificates, plugins, and map sources).

2. **Deployment (Day Of):** At the staging area, Chris selects all three profiles and clicks "Generate Handouts." He prints 100 copies of the resulting 3-page document, each containing role-specific QR codes.

3. **Check-in:** He sets up three check-in tables, each with the corresponding stack of handouts.

4. **Onboarding:** Maria, the paramedic, arrives. She is directed to the "EMS" table, where she picks up a handout. She opens her ATAK client, scans the QR codes on the sheet, and in under a minute is connected to the EMS server with the correct maps loaded. She never had to speak to Chris or type anything.

### 8. Release Plan & Roadmap

### 9. Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

* This platform will **not** have a server-side backend or require user accounts. All user-generated data (Profiles) is stored locally in the browser.
* This platform will **not** host any files (e.g., data packages). It only links to them or generates them locally.
* This platform will **not** be a native application distributed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
* This platform will **not** directly connect to or manage TAK servers. It only generates configuration data.
* This platform will **not** include real-time collaboration features. All configuration is done locally.

### 10. Assumptions & Dependencies

* **Assumption:** End-users have a functional version of ATAK or iTAK capable of scanning QR codes.
* **Dependency:** The platform's functionality is dependent on the `tak://` URL schema defined by the TAK Product Center. Any changes to this schema may require an update to the tool.
* **Assumption:** Users have basic familiarity with TAK concepts and terminology.
* **Assumption:** Organizations have established TAK server infrastructure.
* **Dependency:** Modern web browser with PWA support for offline functionality.

### 11. Open Questions

* Should the platform support additional TAK client types beyond ATAK and iTAK?
* What is the optimal QR code size for field deployment scenarios?
* Should profile data be exportable for backup/sharing purposes?
* How can we best support multi-agency deployments with different server configurations?
* What additional data package types should be supported for URL imports?
